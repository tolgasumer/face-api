Algorithm Description:
The knn classifier is first trained on a set of labeled (known) faces and can then predict the person
in an unknown image by finding the k most similar faces (images with closet face-features under eucledian distance)
in its training set, and performing a majority vote (possibly weighted) on their label.

For example, if k=3, and the three closest face images to the given image in the training set are one image of Biden
and two images of Obama, The result would be 'Obama'.

* This implementation uses a weighted vote, such that the votes of closer-neighbors are weighted more heavily.

*** NOTE: This is the original face_recognition_knn example from the face_recognition library, 
slightly modified to work with base64 images that are parsed from flask endpoints. You can use this approach
to modify any other function from the original face_recognition library to make it work with an active stateless flask backend.
